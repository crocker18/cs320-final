# cs320_final
This was my final project for CS320 (Data Programming II) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison spring 2020.

This project was an analysis and visualization of tornado data in the United States from 1950-2020. The complete project can be found at https://tyler.caraza-harter.com/cs320/s20/final/5/index.html. This merely contains the python notebook where code was written to find meaning in the data. I don't have much experience with GitHub, so I hope this works. Lastly, there are more than a few dependencies, but I am not going to go into that considering I'm mainly using this site to store this project for future reference.
